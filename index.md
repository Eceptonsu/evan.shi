Hello, and welcome! My name is **Evan (Bowen) Shi**. I've recently graduated from **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute**, earning dual degrees in Computer Science and Game Simulation Art Science. Now, I am pursuing a master's degree in Computer Science in a two-year program at **Yale University**. This site is my open book where I express myself and share my interest in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Computer Vision. As you journey through my website, you'll discover more about my academic path, professional milestones, and passion that propels me forward in this ever-evolving field.
