  Finding Flora is a relaxing third-person platformer where you play as a simple caterpillar, infatuated with a beautiful flower you saw as you hatched from your egg. Traverse the
  treetops of a dense forest and avoid predators as you climb trees and hop from branch to branch to eat tasty leaves. Eat enough and you are able to metamorphose into an exquisite
  butterfly, all in order to reach that flower on the forest floor.

This game emerged as a brainchild of our team for the Game Development I course (GASA 4520) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The task at hand was to craft a game based on serveral keyswords (or constraints), awhich for us, morphed into ***forest*** and ***evolve***. At the end, we had Finding Flora, which is about a catepillar climb, eat, and survive as it journey to the forest floor.

## Key Features

* Evolution: Embark on a journey from a caterpillar to a butterfly, aiming to reach a beautiful flower.
* Survival: Avoid dangerous spiders and birds lurking in the forest and treetops, eying you as their next snack.
* Exploration: Travel from branch to branch, eating as many leaves as you can to fuel your transformation!
