Submitty is an open-source course management and grading system primarily used by the Computer Science department at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Upon joining the team, I dedicated the initial month to familiarizing myself with Submitty's architecture, alongside gaining a foundational understanding of languages including PHP and JavaScript. Then, as I became more familiar with Submitty, I focused mainly on enhancing front end features such as **simple grading**. Additionally, I enhanced various PDF functionalities within the grading interface, particularly the **PDF annotation** feature, enabling graders to overlay custom marks on submitted PDF files during evaluation. I also speny a significant amount of time to refining the expected string feature, which allows the use of **expected_string** within assignment configurations. If you want to learn more about my code contribuations, here is a complete list of [my commits](\https://github.com/Submitty/Submitty/pulls?q=author%3AEceptonsu+) on GitHub.

Working at Submitty allowed me to learn about techniques and further understand the principles behind practical applications. I will continue to contribute in my free time.
