  summary: >
    I completed my BS in Computer Science & Game Simulation Art Science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute 
    and am now pursuing an MS in Computer Science at Yale University. This educational journey has equipped me 
    with a solid programming and game development foundation. I am proficient in many programming languages, 
    including C, C++, and Python. My experience in game engines like Unity and Unreal has further expanded 
    my technical horizon, enabling me to bring imaginative game concepts to life. Additionally, 
    I am actively involved in the rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Processing, 
    contributing to research initiatives that delve into AI creativity.
